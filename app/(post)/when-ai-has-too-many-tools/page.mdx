Last week, Anthropic published [a blog post about building AI agents with tools](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol). Think of it like giving your AI a toolbox - email access, file management, web search, etc. The more tools you add, the more powerful your AI becomes.

Except there's a catch.

## My Tool Problem

I had 11 different tool servers running for Claude. That's 128 individual tools. Gmail, GitHub, file systems, web browsers - you name it, I had it configured.

**Wait - what's a "server"?** Think of it like a department at Home Depot. You don't buy "tools" - you go to the Plumbing Department, the Electrical Department, etc. Each department (server) has its own collection of related tools.

Here's what my setup looked like:

| Server | Tools Available | What It Does |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Gmail | 13 tools | send_email, search_emails, read_email, create_label... |
| GitHub | 26 tools | create_repository, create_pull_request, search_code... |
| Desktop Commander | 16 tools | read_file, write_file, execute_command, search_files... |
| Puppeteer | 7 tools | navigate_browser, click_element, take_screenshot... |
| Memory | 11 tools | create_entities, search_nodes, add_observations... |
| Brave Search | 2 tools | web_search, web_fetch |

**The problem?** Every time I asked Claude a question, it had to load information about all 128 tools into its "working memory" (we call these tokens). Imagine trying to think while someone reads you the instruction manual for every tool in Home Depot. That's what I was doing to Claude.

## The Audit That Changed Everything

We built something called a "Tool Registry" - basically a smart index that catalogs all your tools so you can find them quickly. Think of it like a card catalog at a library instead of wandering through every aisle.

When we ran the registry against my setup, we discovered something surprising: **only 5-6 of my 11 servers were actually working properly**. The rest? Just sitting there, consuming tokens and doing nothing.

Using the registry's analysis, we optimized:
- **Before:** 11 servers, 128 tools, ~27,000 tokens
- **After:** 6 servers, 89 tools, ~17,000 tokens
- **Result:** 37% reduction in "brain overhead"

Some tools were redundant (I had three different ways to access files). Some weren't even loading correctly. The registry made this visible in minutes instead of hours of manual debugging.

## The Limitation We Hit

Here's where it gets interesting - and frustrating.

The Tool Registry works beautifully for auditing and optimization. But we can't use it **during** a conversation with Claude. Why? Because Claude can only work with tools that are pre-loaded when the conversation starts. It's like being told "you can only use tools currently in your hands" - you can't run to the toolbox mid-task.

We call this the "static tool limitation." Claude's architecture loads tools at startup, not on-demand.

## Real Use Cases That Work Today

Even with this limitation, the Tool Registry solved real problems:

**Use Case 1: The Initial Setup**  
New to MCP? The registry shows you exactly which tools you have, which ones work, and which ones conflict. Instead of trial-and-error configuration, you get a diagnostic report.

**Use Case 2: The Performance Audit**  
Your Claude feels slow? Run the registry. It'll tell you if you're loading 50 tools when you only use 5. We cut my token overhead by 37% in one session.

**Use Case 3: The Tool Discovery**  
"I need to search my Gmail" - the registry tells you that you have that capability in your `gmail` server under `search_emails`. No more guessing tool names.

## What We Learned

Building this taught me that **sometimes the best tool isn't the one that does everything - it's the one that helps you understand what you already have**.

The Tool Registry won't dynamically fetch tools for Claude mid-conversation. But it will:
- Show you what's broken in your setup
- Identify redundant tools wasting tokens
- Help you configure a lean, fast tool collection

**The takeaway?** Start small. The Anthropic approach works great with 5-10 carefully chosen tools. The registry helps you figure out which 5-10 tools those should be.

We're still exploring ways to make dynamic tool loading work. But until then, we have a system that makes the static approach dramatically better.
