This entire directory (app/when-ai-has-too-many-tools) should be deleted.

The correct blog post is located at: app/(post)/when-ai-has-too-many-tools/

This duplicate is causing a build error:
"You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path."

To fix: Delete this entire app/when-ai-has-too-many-tools directory.
